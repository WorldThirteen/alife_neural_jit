# Neural Network computational graph generation for fast and scalable computation in Alife models in web.

Two approaches are presented in this repository:
- The baseline approach of network built with neataptic.js;
- The computational graph code generation approach to utilize fast JS engines JIT compilation.


Requirements:
- Node.js;
- npm;

To run the code:
Clone the repository;
- `npm install`;
- `npm run build`;
- `npm run test`;
